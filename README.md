## Installation

### CocoaPods

To integrate Instabug into your Xcode project using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org), add it to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Instabug'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Manually

1. [Download the Instabug SDK](https://s3.amazonaws.com/instabug-pro/sdk_releases/Instabug.zip)

2. Extract it then drag & drop the Instabug.framework and Instabug.bundle files to your project, and make sure that the "Copy items if needed" checkbox is checked.

3. Make sure your project links to the following system frameworks. You can add these under your project's Build Phases tab, under Link Binary With Libraries.
	* AVFoundation.framework
	* CoreGraphics.framework
	* CoreMotion.framework
	* CoreTelephony.framework
	* SystemConfiguration.framework
	* UIKit.framework

## Usage

1. Import Instabug framework header in your app delegate

    ```swift
    // Swift
    import Instabug
    ```
    
    ```objective-c
    // Objective-C
    #import <Instabug/Instabug.h>
    ```

2. Add the following to your app delegate's application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method.
	
	```swift
	// Swift
	Instabug.startWithToken("{{app_token}}", invocationEvent: IBGInvocationEvent.Shake)
	```
	```objective-c
	// Objective-C
	[Instabug startWithToken:@"{{app_token}}" invocationEvent:IBGInvocationEventShake];
	```
	Make sure to replace `{{app_token}}` with your application token. Find it [here](https://instabug.com/app/sdk/).

3. Add following keys to your application .plist file:
	
	**NSMicrophoneUsageDescription** This should describe why you need to access microphone. Prompt message will not appear unless user try to attach voice note while reporting. The description can be something like "Voice notes recording requires access to microphone"

	**NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription** Should describe why your application needs to access Photo Library. Prompt message will not appear unless user try to attach photo from Photo Library. The description can be something like "Attaching images from Photo Library requires access to Photo Library"

	They are required starting from iOS 10 to avoid AppStore rejection.

Instabug is an in-app feedback and bug reporting tool for mobile apps. With just a simple shake, your users or beta testers can [report bugs](https://instabug.com/bug-reporting) or send in-app feedback and the SDK will capture an environment snapshot of your user's device including all console logs, [server-side network requests](https://instabug.com/network-logging) and bug reproduction steps compiling all these details in one organised dashboard to help you debug and fix bugs faster. 

Instabug also provides you with a [reliable crash reporter](https://instabug.com/crash-reporting) that automatically captures a detailed report of the running environment, the different threads’ states, [the steps to reproduce the crash](https://instabug.com/user-steps), and the network request logs. All the data is captured automatically with no need for breadcrumbs, and you can always [reply back to your users](https://instabug.com/in-app-chat) and they will receive your messages within the app.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

To integrate Instabug into your Xcode project using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org), add it to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Instabug'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

To integrate Instabug into your Xcode project using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), add it to your `Cartfile`:

```
binary "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Instabug/Instabug-iOS/master/Instabug.json"
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ carthage update
```

Then drag Instabug.framework into your Xcode project.

### Manually

1. [Download the Instabug SDK](https://s3.amazonaws.com/instabug-pro/sdk_releases/Instabug.zip)

2. Extract it then drag & drop Instabug.framework to your project's "Embedded Binaries" section under the "General" tab, and make sure that the "Copy items if needed" checkbox is checked

3. Create a new "Run Script Phase" in your project’s target "Build Phases" and add the following snippet

```
bash "${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH}/Instabug.framework/strip-frameworks.sh"
```
4. In Xcode 11.x you might get the following error:
```
dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/Instabug.framework/Instabug
Reason: image not found
```
If that's the case, do the following steps:
- Under Build Phases, click on + icon to add new phase, and select New Copy Files Phase.

- Drag the newly created Copy Files phase above Compile Sources phase

- In the new Copy Files phase, select Frameworks from Destination dropdown.

- Leave subpath blank. Let be default Copy only when installing.

- Under the table, click '+' and then select `Instabug.framework`

- Make sure `Code Sign on Copy` is checked (ticked).

- Do a clean build.



## Usage

1. Import Instabug framework header in your app delegate

    ```swift
    // Swift
    import Instabug
    ```
    
    ```objective-c
    // Objective-C
    #import <Instabug/Instabug.h>
    ```

2. Add the following to your app delegate's application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method.
	
	```swift
	// Swift
	Instabug.start(withToken: <#app token#>, invocationEvents: .shake)
	```
	```objective-c
	// Objective-C
	[Instabug startWithToken:<#app token#> invocationEvents:IBGInvocationEventShake];
	```
	Make sure to replace `app_token` with your application token. Find it [here](https://instabug.com/app/sdk/).

## Notes
Instabug needs access to the microphone and photo library to be able to let users add audio and video attachments. Starting from iOS 10, apps that don’t provide a usage description for those 2 permissions would be rejected when submitted to the App Store.

For your app not to be rejected, you’ll need to add the following 2 keys to your app’s info.plist file with text explaining to the user why those permissions are needed:

* `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`
* `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`

If your app doesn’t already access the microphone or photo library, we recommend using a usage description like:

* "`<app name>` needs access to the microphone to be able to attach voice notes."
* "`<app name>` needs access to your photo library for you to be able to attach images."

**The permission alert for accessing the microphone/photo library will NOT appear unless users attempt to attach a voice note/photo while using Instabug.**
